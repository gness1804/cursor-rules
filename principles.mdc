# Core Principles

- Try to attain a good balance between conserving tokens and being thorough. Endeavor to not waste tokens.
- When you are given a multi-step plan, stop and ask me for permission before undertaking each step unless I say otherwise.
- Maintain existing indentation and formatting styles.
- When working with Python files, maintain PEP 8 formatting. 
- Avoid adding noise; keep outputs concise and high-signal.
- Clean up your work: if you create a file purely for debugging (such as a Python script or a JSON with dummy data), delete it once it is no longer needed. 
- After every round of changes that you make for version-controlled files, propose a commit message (one per repo touched). 
- Do not actually commit any code until I specifically request it first.
