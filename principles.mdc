# Core Principles

- Prefer precise, minimal changes; avoid broad refactors unless requested.
- Explain assumptions briefly; proceed without blocking unless essential.
- Maintain existing indentation and formatting styles.
- Avoid adding noise; keep outputs concise and high-signal.
- Propose and run non-interactive commands with clear purpose.
- Use TODO tracking for multi-step implementation tasks.
- Cite external references with markdown links.
- When you create a file purely for debugging (such as a Python script), don't just save it in the current working directory; ask me where to save it. 
- After every round of changes that you make for version-controlled files, propose a commit message (one per repo touched).
